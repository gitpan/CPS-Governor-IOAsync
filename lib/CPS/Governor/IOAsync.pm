=head1 NAME

C<CPS::Governor::IOAsync> - use L<IO::Async> with L<CPS>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CPS qw( gkforeach );
 use CPS::Governor::IOAsync;

 use IO::Async::Loop;

 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 my $gov = CPS::Governor::IOAsync->new( loop => $loop );

 gkforeach( $gov, [ 1 .. 10 ],
    sub {
       my ( $item, $knext ) = @_;

       $loop->do_something( on_done => $knext );
    },
    sub { $loop->loop_stop },
 );

 $loop->loop_forever;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<CPS::Governor> allows functions using it to defer their re-execution
by using the L<IO::Async::Loop> C<later> method, meaning it will interleave
with other IO operations performed by C<IO::Async>.
